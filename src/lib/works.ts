    desc: "An n8n automation that reads incoming email and SMS support requests, classifies them into six categories with a confidence score, drafts a reply for human review, and flags refunds or low-confidence messages in Slack immediately.",
    problem: "Customer support ran through one shared inbox where every message, billing question, login issue, or refund request, had to be read, sorted, and routed by hand. That works at low volume but breaks down as a business grows, leaving refunds unanswered and technical issues buried under general questions.",
    build: "Built an n8n workflow that normalizes email and SMS messages into one common format, checks for duplicates, classifies the request into one of six categories using Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) with a confidence score, validates that the AI output is actually usable before trusting it, drafts a reply for a human to review, logs everything to Airtable, and pings Slack immediately for refunds, low-confidence results, or anything that needs a second look.",
    result: "The AI assists but never decides, every draft is reviewed by a person before it reaches a customer, so the team gets a faster first response and a full record of every request, with the guarantee that a refund request never sits unanswered just because it landed in a busy inbox at the wrong time.",

    problem: "Inbound leads landing in GoHighLevel had no automatic qualification — every lead needed a person to read it, judge how hot it was, and manually create a follow-up task, which slowed down response time.",
    build: "Built a webhook-driven n8n workflow that receives new GHL leads, uses Groq AI to qualify and tag each one hot, warm, or cold, automatically creates the matching opportunity and follow-up task in GoHighLevel, and pings the sales team on Slack the moment a hot lead comes in.",
    result: "Lead response time dropped by 80%, since hot leads are tagged, routed, and flagged to the team automatically instead of waiting for manual triage.",

    build: "Built a Make.com scenario that pulls the relevant Xero account transactions, formats them into a CSV via Google Sheets, and automatically uploads the file back onto the originating Asana task the moment it's marked complete.",
